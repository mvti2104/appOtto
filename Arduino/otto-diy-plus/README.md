**Background information:**

‚Äã

Otto is truly Opensource; it means the hardware is easily discerned so that others can make it, Arduino compatible, 3D printable and customizable, the perfect opportunity to build and have your very first robot, learn robotics and have fun, you will learn the logical connection between code and action, and by assembling it, you will understand how its components and electronics work. Visit www.ottodiy.com for more detailed info.

### **Build Your Own Robot**

## How it Works



Otto DIY+ \("PLUS"\) can make everything that basic [Otto DIY Starter](https://wikifactory.com/+OttoDIY/otto-diy) does but with enhanced stronger motors + Bluetooth + APP + touch and sound sensor. It has broader ways of inteaction and control.

## Part List



### Otto DIY+ can be made with [builder kit+ \(full with 3D printed parts included\) or a maker kit+ \(only electronics\)](https://store.ottodiy.com/product/plus/) or create your own robot with this open source content by finding the parts yourself.

* 1 x Nano ATmega328
* 1 √ó Nano Shield I/O
* 1 √ó USB-A to Mini-USB Cable
* 1 √ó Bluetooth module BLE
* 1 √ó Ultrasound sensor HC-SR04
* 4 x Micro servo MG90
* 1 √ó Buzzer
* 10 √ó DuPont Female/Female wires
* 1 √ó Sound sensor
* 1 √ó Touch sensor

‚Äã

**3D printed parts:**

Parts to print are available under this project [Files/ 3D Printing](https://wikifactory.com/+OttoDIY/otto-diy-plus/files/3D%20printing)

* 1 x Head
* 1 x Body
* 2 x Legs
* 1 x Foot Left
* 1 x Foot Right

‚Äã

**Tools:**

* 1 x Generic soldering iron \(not required with our kits\)
* 1 x Phillips screwdriver \(not required with our kits\)
* Scissors or clippers



## 3D Printing




**If you bought a Builder kit you can skip ahead** but if you have the Maker kit you have to[ 3D print the parts ](https://wikifactory.com/+OttoDIY/otto-diy/files/3Dprint)but Otto is very well designed for 3D printing, so it won't give you trouble if you follow this common parameters:

* Recommended to use a FDM 3D printer with PLA material.
* Parts are already oriented for optimum print therefore no need supports or rafts.
* Resolution: 0.28mm
* Fill density 15%
* At least 3 Perimeters
* Warping might occur when not having a hot bed and properly calibrated printer

‚Äã

it should take around 5 hours to 3D print a full set of parts for one Otto.




## Software

### For beginners it is recommended to start coding by using our new Blockly a simple visual programming software:

Otto Blockly is completely autonomous \(no need for Arduino IDE, or libraries setup and no Internet access is required\).

‚Äã

1. Download Ôªøfrom our website
2. Install Otto Blockly.
3. Open an example.
4. Connect your Otto robot.
5. Make sure is in Arduino nano\*, **USB port where Otto is connected.**
6. Upload

Yes is that easy!

## Electronics


### You should check your connections and test your robot with the USB cable connected to a computer.

As a good practice you should check your electronics and software in your computer, before assembling all robot to avoid having to disassemble the whole robot to fix something. You can do this by just connecting all the servos, in the place indicated in the wring below and upload any code that makes Otto move with Otto Blockly or Arduino.
